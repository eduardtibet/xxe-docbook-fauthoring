# xxe docbook fauthoring FAQ

## Why xxe-docbook-fauthoring and what does it mean?

Because it's quite simple and sounds good :)

The name of the project is formed from a three parts:
- the name of the editor - XMLMind XML Editor or XXE, for short;
- the name of the authoring standard - DocBook/XML;
- a word "fauthoring" which is originated and formed from a words **f**ast and **authoring**. 

## Why xxe docbook fauthoring was created?

Short answer: to make a technical documentation editing easy.

Long answer:
The author of the [xxe docbook fauthoring](https://github.com/eduardtibet/xxe-docbook-fauthoring/) project is a technical writer/documentation engineer by profession. He primary uses [DocBook/XML](https://docbook.org/) as a source for documentation (of course, he sometimes also uses lightweight markup languages like asciidoc, ReStructured text, Markdown).

DocBook/XML markup language is great for a technical documentation, but reveals all its advantages only within a complex documentation projects.

To get his job done author uses [XMLMind XML Editor](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/) for over 12 years. Despite some people finds that XXE is a tool with a steep learning curve, actually it is not. Instead it has some gap that makes an editing methods and techniques slightly different from an ordinary WYSIWYG editor (like MS Word, LibreOffice, et al.). Please, note, that XXE is WYSIWY**M** and not a WYSIWY**G** editor due to a separation a content from it's presentation.   

While authoring a DocBook-based documents someone faces an editing specific aspects of such documents. Despite DocBook/XML is a xml-based markup language with a huge amount of markup tags, day-by-day activity assumes using only a certain amount of tags/elements. I.e. tags `<section>`, `<para>` are used much more frequently than the other ones (i.e. `<personname>`). That is why, using a keyboard shortcuts and other helpers for such elements makes XXE even more effective tool than it is by default.

XXE by default contains helpers and shortcuts for editing a documents of different types, but these shortcuts are spread equally among the full range of editing possibilities and features - they are not suitable for a really fast authoring DocBook documents in particular having in mind an above specific aspects of editing of such documents.

Author's project goal is to pick out such DocBook elements and to make a helpers to make a XXE a time-saving tool while editing most of a common DocBook/XML-based documents for IT-related field. 

**NOTE**: BTW, XMLMind XML Editor (XXE, for short) is free for use for any non-commercial and open source projects - see [license](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/license_xxe_perso.html) for a details. You can download and use it for such projects for free [download link](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml) 

As a result:

- you can author your DocBook/XML-based documents even faster that default XXE configuration allows you to do this;

- it you have any particular needs, you can extend a current configuration (project) according your own requirements.
